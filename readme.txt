Brown,
Differential effects of Kv7 (M-) channels on synaptic integration in distinct subcellular compartments of rat
hippocampal pyramidal neurons. J Physiol. 2011 589:6029-38.

In this study, using a combination of electrophysiology
and computational modelling, we show that these channels selectively influence
peri-somatic but not dendritic post-synaptic excitatory synaptic potential (EPSP) integration in
CA1 pyramidal cells. This may be important for their relative contributions to physiological
processes such as synaptic plasticity as well as patho-physiological conditions such as epilepsy.
The fig-3c.hoc reproduces the traces shown in Fig.3c of the paper.


Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui fig-3c.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
fig-3c.hoc 
will open the simulation window.
